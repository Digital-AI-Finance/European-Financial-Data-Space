### 1.2 Critical Citation Gaps

#### UNSOURCED CLAIMS (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Section: Executive Summary (Line 290)**
> "Critical policy gap: current framework neglects data quality standards for AI applications"

**Issue:** This is a major claim presented as fact without immediate citation. While supported later by Oxford journal article, needs citation at first mention.

**Recommendation:** Add inline citation: "...data quality standards for AI applications (Borowicz, 2024)."

---

**Section: Evolution (Line 361)**
> "Finance was selected early as a priority sector because financial data are central to supervision, capital allocation, consumer services and innovation"

**Issue:** No citation provided for this policy rationale.

**Recommendation:** Cite European Commission's European Strategy for Data (2020) or Expert Group report (2022).

---

**Section: Evolution (Line 362)**
> "That Expert Group reported in October 2022 with a practical definition of 'open finance' use cases"

**Issue:** Expert Group report mentioned but not formally cited in References section.

**Recommendation:** Add to References:

**Issue:** Direct quote without citation to source document.

**Recommendation:** Add citation: (AFME, EBF, Insurance Europe, 2024) and full reference in bibliography.

---

**Section: ESMA Role (Line 464)**
> "Building on the initial success of ESEF..."

**Issue:** "Success" claimed without metrics or citation.

**Recommendation:** Either provide adoption statistics with citation or reframe as "implementation" instead of "success."

---

**Section: ESMA Role (Line 474-477)**
> Verena Ross quote

**Issue:** Quote has citation to speech but missing full details.

**Recommendation:** Add full citation in APA/Chicago format:
- Ross, V. (2025, November 7). "Keynote speech at the 11th International Financial Markets Conference." European Securities and Markets Authority. https://www.esma.europa.eu/...

---

**Section: MSCA Perspectives (Line 660)**
> "A recurring consideration is the lack of common standards... SDMX standard already promoted by the ECB and BIS"

**Issue:** ECB and BIS promotion of SDMX claimed without citation.

## 2. METHODOLOGY TRANSPARENCY

### 2.1 MSCA Fellows' Perspectives Section (Line 655-670)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Methodology completely unclear.

**Current Statement (Line 657):**
> "Based on the reports submitted by the Doctoral Candidates of the MSCA Digital program, key themes were identified that complement the policy analysis above"

**Problems:**
1. **Sample size:** How many doctoral candidates? Not stated.
2. **Analysis method:** How were "key themes identified"? Qualitative coding? Thematic analysis? Content analysis?
3. **Data collection:** Were these written reports? Interviews? Surveys?
4. **Selection criteria:** Which reports were included/excluded?
5. **Timeframe:** When were these reports submitted?
6. **Ethics:** Was ethical approval obtained for using doctoral candidates' work?
7. **Attribution:** Are individual fellows' contributions acknowledged?

**Recommendation for Academic Publication:**

Add a dedicated subsection:

```markdown
### 2.5 Methodology: MSCA Digital Fellows Survey

**Research Design:** Qualitative thematic analysis of MSCA Digital program doctoral candidates' reports.

**Sample:** [N=X] doctoral candidates from the MSCA DIGITAL Industrial Doctoral Network (Project No 101119635) submitted written reports on EFDS implementation challenges between [Month Year] and [Month Year].

**Data Collection:** Written reports ranged from [X-Y] pages and addressed [specific prompt/questions provided to fellows].

**Analysis:** The research team conducted thematic analysis using [coding framework/software]. Initial open coding identified [N] preliminary themes, which were consolidated into 4 major themes through iterative review by [number] researchers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using [method, e.g., Cohen's kappa = X].

**Ethical Approval:** This research was conducted under ethical approval [number] from [institution]. All participants provided informed consent for their reports to be analyzed for policy recommendations.

**Limitations:** This represents perspectives of early-career researchers in digital finance and may not capture the full range of industry or regulatory viewpoints.
```

### 2.2 Policy Recommendations

**Issue:** Recommendations presented without explicit criteria for prioritization.

**Current:** Priority labels (High/Medium/Low) appear in Recommendations Summary but criteria not explained.

**Recommendation:** Add methodological note:

```markdown
**Priority Classification Criteria:**
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting EFDS core functionality before 2027 launch; significant consumer protection concerns; explicit regulatory gaps
- **Medium Priority:** Enhancement opportunities; cross-regulatory alignment needs; 2027-2030 implementation phase concerns
- **Low Priority:** Ongoing refinement; post-2030 considerations
```

## 9. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Assessment

The EFDS Policy White Paper demonstrates **solid foundational research** and **good policy intuition** but falls short of academic publication standards in its current form. The paper's greatest strengths are its **timeliness**, **practical policy recommendations**, and **integration of recent regulatory developments**. Its greatest weaknesses are **insufficient citation of claims**, **lack of methodological transparency**, and **missing academic literature from 2024-2025**.

### Primary Recommendation

**FOR POLICY BRIEF:**
- Complete Priority 1 revisions (citations and methodology)
- Publish as MSCA Digital project white paper or submit to European Commission policy channels
- **Estimated timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**FOR ACADEMIC PUBLICATION:**
- Complete Priority 1 + Priority 2 revisions
- Target International Journal of Law and Information Technology (Oxford) - good fit with existing citations
- Consider splitting into two papers:
  1. "Data Quality Governance Gaps in the European Financial Data Space" (focus on Section 3)
  2. "Implementation Challenges of Open Finance Regulation: Evidence from MSCA Digital Fellows" (focus on Section 10 with full methodology)
- **Estimated timeline:** 4-6 months

### Final Note

The paper makes valuable policy contributions and identifies genuine regulatory gaps (data quality framework, AI governance integration, SME access mechanisms). These insights deserve wider dissemination. With systematic citation improvements and methodological transparency, this work can meet academic standards while retaining policy relevance.
